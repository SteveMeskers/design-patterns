# DESCRIPTION
A component that facilitates communication between other components without them necessarily being aware of each other or having direct (reference) access to each other

# USE CASE
Components may go in and out of a system at any time
    - Chat room
    - Players in MMORPG

It makes no sense for them to have direct references to one another

## EXERCISE
Our system has any number of instances of Participant  classes. Each Participant has a value integer attribute, initially zero.

A participant can say()  a particular value, which is broadcast to all other participants. At this point in time, every other participant is obliged to increase their value  by the value being broadcast.

Example:

Two participants start with values 0 and 0 respectively

Participant 1 broadcasts the value 3. We now have Participant 1 value = 0, Participant 2 value = 3

Participant 2 broadcasts the value 2. We now have Participant 1 value = 2, Participant 2 value = 3
