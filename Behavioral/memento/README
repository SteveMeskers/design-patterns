# DESCRIPTION
A token/handle representing the system state. Lets us roll back to the state when the token was generated. May or may not directly expose state information. If the information is immutable then there is no problem exposing it

# USE CASE
An object or system goes through changes
    - Bank accounts get deposits and withdrawls
There are different ways of navigating those changes
One way is to record every change (Command pattern) and teach a command to 'undo' itself
Another is to simply save snapshots of the system (memento)

## EXERCISE
A TokenMachine  is in charge of keeping tokens. Each Token  is a reference type with a single numerical value. The machine supports adding tokens and, when it does, it returns a memento representing the state of that system at that given time.

You are asked to fill in the gaps and implement the Memento design pattern for this scenario. Pay close attention to the situation where a token is fed in as a reference and its value is subsequently changed on that reference - you still need to return the correct system snapshot!
