# DESCRIPTION
Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code

# USE CASE
Balancing complexity and usablity/presentation. Ex a house has many subsystems but the end user is not exposed to them

## EXERCISE
A magic square is a square matrix of numbers where the sum in each row, each column, and each of the diagonals is the same.

You are given a system of 3 classes that can be used to make a magic square. The classes are:

Generator: this class generates a 1-dimensional list of random digits in range 1 to 9.

Splitter: this class takes a 2D list and splits it into all possible arrangements of 1D lists. It gives you the columns, the rows and the two diagonals.

Verifier: this class takes a 2D list and verifies that the sum of elements in every sublist is the same.

Please implement a Fa√ßade class called MagicSquareGenerator  which simply generates the magic square of a given size.
