# DESCRIPTION
A component that is solely responsible for wholesale object creation (not piece-wise)

# USE CASE
Object creation is too convoluted
Too many optional args in constructor

## EXERCISE
You are given a class called Person . The person has two attributes: id , and name .

Please implement a  PersonFactory that has a non-static  create_person()  method that takes a person's name and return a person initialized with this name and an id.

The id of the person should be set as a 0-based index of the object created. So, the first person the factory makes should have Id=0, second Id=1 and so on.
