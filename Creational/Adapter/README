# DESCRIPTION
A construct which adapts an existing interface x to conform to the required interface y

# USE CASE
When the api you are using doesnt match what you are working with

## EXERCISE
You are given a class called Square and a function calculate_area() which calculates the area of a given rectangle.

In order to use Square in calculate_area, instead of augmenting it with width/height members, please implement the SquareToRectangleAdapter class. This adapter takes a square and adapts it in such a way that it can be used as an argument to calculate_area().
